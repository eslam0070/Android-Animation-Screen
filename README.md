## How to create Animation in Android

A tween animation can perform a series of simple transformations (position, size, rotation, and transparency) on the contents of a View object. So, if you have a TextView object, you can move, rotate, grow, or shrink the text. If it has a background image, the background image will be transformed along with the text. The animation package provides all the classes used in a tween animation. You can read more about [animation](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/view-animation.html).

Here we will create an animated image that will rotate before opening App. So a user will see first a rotating image which will be referred as animated splash screen and then Hello World print will come (which is part of MainActitvity). Now letâ€™s start making our Android Splash Screen.
